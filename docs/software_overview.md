!!! note
	The mosaic-X5 module has numerous capabilities and a multitude of ways to configure and interface with them. Without regurgitating all the information that is documented in Septentrio's user manuals and videos, we have tried to highlight a good majority of the module's aspects.

	With that said, please feel free to [file an issue](../github/file_issue/#discrepancies-in-the-documentation) if you feel we have missed something that may benefit other users. *(Don't forget to provide us with a link to the documentation and what section the information is located.)*


## RxTools Software Suite

!!! tip
	Even if you aren't necessarily interested it, we highly recommend that users install the [RXTools software suite](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gps-gnss-receiver-software/rxtools) before plugging in their board. For Windows PCs, it also includes the USB driver for the module that enables the Ethernet-over-USB support and virtual `COM` ports.

Users should install the [RXTools software suite](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gps-gnss-receiver-software/rxtools) on their computer to interact with the mosaic-X5 module through the USB interface. The software package includes the USB-IP driver[^1] necessary to recognize the board as an ethernet device on Windows PCs (1).

		* RxAssistant
		* RxLauncher

		</div>

		</div>


	=== "Linux[^1]"
		!!! warning
			It is recommended that users **<span style="color:red">NOT</span>** install RxControl as `root`, for security reasons and to avoid installation overwrites of other system settings. To make RxTools available to more than one user, provide a shared installation directory.

		Users can install RxTools software suite by running the installation binary[^4](1), located in the `RxTools/linux-i386/` directory of the downloaded `*.zip` file[^5]. During the installation, users will be prompted for an installation directory. If there are any previous installations of RxControl, please use a different directory to avoid conflicts.
		{ .annotate }

		1. For RxTools v22.1.0, the installation filename is `RxTools_22_1_0_Installer.bin` for Linux.

		??? info "Permission Settings"
			Once installed, users may need to reconfigure their permission settings:

			<div class="annotate" markdown>

			* RxTools will need rights to access the `/dev/ttyS*` serial ports.

				* To access the serial ports, users must be part of the `uucp` and `lock` groups (1). This can be configured by editing the `/etc/group`[^7] file and adding the username to the lines defining the `uucp` group and the `lock` group.

					For example, when adding the user `jsmith` to the `uucp` group, users would modify the `/etc/group` file as shown below:

					```bash
					{--uucp:x:14:uucp--} # (2)!
					{++uucp:x:14:uucp,jsmith++} # (3)!
					```

				* On Linux machine administered centrally on a local network, ask your system administrator to be included in the `uucp` and `lock` groups.
			* RxTools also needs read/write (`rw`) access(4) to the `/dev/ttyS*` serial ports.

				* Users can change the permissions with the `chmod`[^8] command:

					```bash
					chmod 660 /dev/ttyS<add port> # (5)!>
					```

			</div>

			1. On most Linux operating systems, the `/dev/ttyS*` devices are owned by `root` and belong to the `uucp` group with read/write (`rw`) access. Additionally, the devices are normally locked by writing a file in the `/var/lock/` directory, with the same permissions.
			2. Remove
			3. Replace with this line
			4. By default, users will normally have read/write (`rw`) access to the `/dev/ttyS*` serial ports.
			5. where users must specify the port number<br>*e.g. `/dev/ttyS0` might be port `COM1`*

			!!! note
				In order for these changes to take effect, users must update their environment by logging out and back in.

				Be aware that the X-session has to be restarted as well. On most systems, this can be done by pressing the key combination ++ctrl++ + ++alt++ + ++backspace++

		??? info "64-bit OS"
			In order to run the RxTools on a 64-bit Linux operating system, users might to install the 32-bit version of the `C` standard library.

			* For Fedora installations, this is the `glibc.i686` package.
			* The equivalent for Debian(/Ubuntu) installations is the `ia32-libs` package.

	[^4]: Users will need administrative privileges to install the RxTools software.
	[^5]: Users may need to extract the RxTools installation files from the downloaded, compressed file.
	[^6]: Please see the release notes for the issues and limitations of the RxTools applications.
	[^7]: Requires c privileges.
	[^8]: Changing these permissions also requires `root` privileges.


## USB Driver
=== "Windows"
	If users haven't already installed the [RxTools software suite](https://www.septentrio.com/en/products/gps-gnss-receiver-software/rxtools) on their Windows PC, they will need to install the USB driver[^1] necessary to recognize and interact with the mosaic-X5 module through the USB interface.

	A Windows USB driver for the mosaic-X5 can be installed through two methods:

	<div class="annotate" markdown>

	* RxTools Software Suite (1)
	* mosaic-X5 GNSS Receiver Module (2)

	</div>

	1. The driver is installed during the installation process.
	2. The installation file for the Windows USB driver will be available from the mass-storage device when the board is initially connected to the computer.

	Once installed, the driver emulates two virtual serial ports, which can be accessed as standard `COM` ports to the receiver.

	??? tip "Terminal Emulators"
		Most [terminal emulation programs](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/112) will not make a distinction between virtual or native COM ports. However, for virtual serial ports, the port settings *(i.e. baudrate, etc.)* are not relevant and the default configuration be used in the terminal emulation program. However, for the physical/native `COM` ports will have the following default setting: 

		* Baudrate: 115200bps
		* Data Bits: 8
		* Parity: No
		* Stop Bits: 1
		* Flow Control: None

	??? tip "Having Trouble?"
		For users who are having trouble installing the USB driver, we have an archived version *(v3.0.2[^9])* of the installation file. Users can download [**version 3.0.2**](./assets/component_documentation/driver/USB_driver_3_0_2_Installer.exe) of the driver, by clicking on the button below.

=== "Linux"
	On Linux, the standard Linux CDC-ACM driver is suitable.


## Web Interface
With the USB driver installed, the mosaic-X5 module supports Ethernet-over-USB. The default IP address allocated for the Ethernet-over-USB interface is `192.168.3.1`. This IP can be entered in any browser to open a connection to the receiver's Web Interface as shown below.

!!! info
	The default IP address cannot be changed; this feature is only to be used when a single receiver is connected to your computer.

??? failure "Invalid IP Address *(WiFi Only)*"
	[One of the documentation pages on Septentrio's website](https://customersupport.septentrio.com/s/article/What-is-the-default-IP-address-to-connect-via-WiFi), specifies a default IP address of `192.168.20.1` for the web interface. However, that address is for a WiFi enabled product and cannot be used with this product.
