With its Real Time Kinematics (RTK) capabilities, the module can achieve a horizontal accuracy of 6mm (~0.25in), vertical accuracy of 1cm (~0.4in) using RTK, and timing precision of 5ns (5 billionths of a second).

The receiver supports the GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Beidou (China), Galileo (Europe), and NavIC (India) constellations, including regional systems (i.e. SBAS and QZSS). With its Real Time Kinematics (RTK) capabilities, the module can achieve a horizontal accuracy of 6mm (~0.25in), vertical accuracy of 1cm (~0.4in) using RTK, and timing precision of 5ns (5 billionths of a second). It also features Septentrio's unique AIM+ technology for interference mitigation and anti-spoofing, ensuring best-in-class reliability and scalable position accuracy.</p> <p>The mosaic-X5 is a sophisticated chip running an internal web server that can be accessed through the USB interface with a standard browser using a Linux/Windows computer. Septentrio also provides dozens of video tutorials to guide users through the configuration settings of their GNSS receivers utilizing the web interface.</p> <p>Beyond the capabilities of the mosaic-X5 module, this board is seamless to operate with no programming skills required. Gone are the times when a microcontroller was required to interface with the GNSS receiver and log data to an SD card. The mosaic-X5 Triband GNSS RTK Breakout can start/stop logging data, without a single line of code, just utilizing a simple button.</p> <p>This breakout board is a perfect middle ground for users who would like to integrate the mosaic-X5 module into a project/enclosure with access to a majority of the module's available pins, similar to Septentrio's developer kit, but in the smaller form factor of their evaluation kit. Or maybe... you just needed a PPS output at a 3.3V logic level.
